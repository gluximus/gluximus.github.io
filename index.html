The Services may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags, local shared objects, hardware-based device identifiers, Operating System-based identifiers, clear GIFs and web beacons. Gluteus Maximus treats information collected by cookies and similar technologies as non-personal data.

Cookies: A “cookie” is a small file stored by your browser when told to do so by a website. Typically websites place a number of different cookies on an end-user’s machine. Some of the cookies are “1st Party,” from the website itself, and others are “3rd party,” belonging to advertising and analytics entities or social networks.  Gluteus Maximus’s cookies do not include personal data and are typically used to quickly identify your device and to “remember” your browser during subsequent visits for purposes of functionality, preferences, and website performance. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your device; however, disabling cookies may affect your ability to use the Services.

Flash cookies & HTML5: Gluteus Maximus may also use Flash cookies (local shared objects) and HTML5 local storage. Flash cookies are small files similar to browser cookies, but which are not stored in the browser and can also be used to remember your settings, to personalize the look and feel of the Services, or for advertising and analytics. You may prevent Flash cookies from being stored by following the instructions provided by Adobe at http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html.

Web Beacons and pixel tags: A “web beacon” or a “pixel tag” is an electronic image (often not visible to the end-user) that allows Gluteus Maximus to count users who have visited certain pages or viewed certain advertisements. Additionally, e-mails and other electronic communications Gluteus Maximus sends to you may contain pixel tags that enable Gluteus Maximus to track your usage of the communication, including whether the communication was opened and/or what links were followed, if any.

Gluteus Maximus may disclose your personal data to third parties in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of Gluteus Maximus’s stock and/or assets or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process provided, however, that this Privacy Policy shall continue to govern such personal data.

Special Note about Children’s Privacy
Gluteus Maximus does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If Gluteus Maximus learns that Gluteus Maximus has inadvertently gathered personal data from children under 13 years of age, Gluteus Maximus will take reasonable measures to promptly delete such personal data from Gluteus Maximus’s records.

Gluteus Maximus understands the need to provide extra privacy protections to users who are children. To that end, features and services such as social networking plug-ins, behaviorally targeted advertising, and collection of data for the purpose of building user profiles are not available to users under 13. Gluteus Maximus also does not allow our third party partners who engage in such practices to access personally identifiable data from users under 13.

Gluteus Maximus and its partners do collect non-personally identifiable data from children. This includes, for example, collection of IP-based geolocation data to ensure that the product, service or features served comply with applicable laws of that nation.

Gluteus Maximus and its partners also collect data to assess general information about the use of products, such as the number of visitors to our sites and services and which sections of a site or service are popular. Gluteus Maximus also uses this data to provide contextually-relevant advertising to users, to prevent users from seeing the same ad repeatedly, and to allow users to personalize their experience on the site or service (for example, to save a high score in a game). Gluteus Maximus and its partners may also use cookies, pixels, hardware-based identifiers, Operating System-based identifiers, and software-set identifiers, to manage and measure the performance of advertising.

Please note that Gluteus Maximus’s partners may have their own policies related to tracking technologies for analytics and ad-serving purposes.  While
Gluteus Maximus requires that companies comply with Gluteus Maximus’s privacy policy before Gluteus Maximus allows those companies to access our sites and services, Gluteus Maximus does not actually control third-party data collection and use. Gluteus Maximus encourages parents to review the list of operators below and to become familiar with those parties policies and practices.

If you have additional questions about Gluteus Maximus’s Privacy Practices related to children under the age of 13, please contact us at info@Gluteus Maximus.net.
